# ABOUT

Hello! My name is Seokhyun (Shawn) Hwang, and I’m a **Ph.D. student in Information**
**Science** at the [**University of**\\
**Washington**](https://www.washington.edu/) in the [**ACE Lab**](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/) (Advisor:
[**Jacob O.**\\
**Wobbrock**](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/)). I completed my Master’s degree in the Intelligent Robotics Program at
[**GIST**](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html), [**HCIS Lab**](https://sites.google.com/view/gist-hcis-lab)
(Advisor: [**SeungJun Kim**](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=AjfRd6wAAAAJ&hl)) in Korea.

**ACTIVITIES**](https://seokhyunhwang.com/EXTRAS). My research interests lie in the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual/Augmented Reality systems. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the interactions between humans and VR/AR systems, and how we can create more realistic and immersive experiences through the use of hardware devices.

I have been working on developing my own VR locomotion method and haptic feedback device, which I am building with my understanding of circuits and mechanics. My goal is to create a device that can enhance the user’s sense of presence and immersion in virtual environments.
